        <h3>The import and export of Technology Metals.</h3>
        <p class="textblock textblock-left">
            We are consuming technology at an high level, but our hunger for tech needs to be stilled with the earth's resources. We only have a limited amount of them and we need to make sure that we don't use them all too fast. The goal of this visualization is to spread awareness about the increasing consumption of Technology metals and the threat that comes when these metals are depleted.
        </p>
        <p class="textblock textblock-right">
            This visualisation displays the worlds import and export of technology metals per country per year in two bar graphs, two stream graphs and a scatterplot. In the menu to the left, different Technology materials can be selected. Hovering the cursor above a certain countries data, highlights this country. The time slider can be used to see the total amount of exported and imported technology metals over a year and the breakdown in countries.
